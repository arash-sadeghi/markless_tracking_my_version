# Tracking of unmarked bees in 2D 
This repository contains code for trajectory matching of unmarked honeybees in 2D descibed in the manuscript
[Markerless tracking of an entire honey bee colony](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.007302v1).
The notebook `track_demo` will walk you through the following steps of the analysis.
Data used to run the notebook can be downloaded [here](https://beepositions.unit.oist.jp/data.tgz).

The training procedured in this notebook might take long if deployed on a CPU. We also prepared a [colab version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18TQx-JVqYgrjJ2T9BxCdHfMZgkQhLtB2)
of the notebook in which the training is performed on a GPU.
